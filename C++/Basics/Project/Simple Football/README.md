# Simple Football Game In C++ (SFML)

There was a University project in first semester and they challenged us to make a game in C++ by using simple concepts (procedural programming) of C++ and the game should be attractive and intriguing to play. I decided to make a football game by implementing SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++ and I end up making this game.

In order to execute the source code you have to ensure the following steps:

## Download SFML Library

First you have to [download](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/) the SFML library

## Configure Your IDE

Now you have to [prepare](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/#getting-started) your IDE so you can use the functions described in the library you just downloaded.

## Learn To Play

Your team is green and the opposite team is red players so can control the green players with the following keys:

  * Arrow keys to move the player (when color is blue).
  * 's' to shot the ball.

enjoy!
